      <p class="firstsection">Early life</p>
      <p class="secondsection"> Krishnakumar Kunnath, popularly known as KK, was born on August 23, 1968, in Thrissur,
        Kerala, India. His
        father, C.S. Nair, was an army officer, and his mother, Kunnath Kanakavalli, was a trained classical singer.
        Growing up, KK developed an interest in music and was inspired by singers such as Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi,
        and Hemant Kumar. He started his music career as a teenager, performing in local music competitions and college
        events.
        After completing his education, KK moved to Mumbai to pursue a career in music. Initially, he struggled to make
        a
        name for himself and worked odd jobs to make ends meet. However, he continued to work on his music and
        eventually
        got his break in the music industry.
        KK's first big break came in 1994 when he was discovered by the composer Louis Banks, who offered him the
        opportunity to sing for a jingle. This led to more work in the advertising industry and eventually opened doors
        for him in the Bollywood film industry.
        Since then, KK has become one of the most successful and sought-after playback singers in India, known for his
        soulful voice and versatile range.
